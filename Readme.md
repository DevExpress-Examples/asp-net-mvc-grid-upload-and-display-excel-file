# GridView - How to upload an Excel file via UploadControl and show its data in a grid

***Note***

In version **19.2**, we renamed our **Range** interface to **CellRange** - see the following BC for details: [The DevExpress.Spreadsheet.Range interface has been renamed to DevExpress.Spreadsheet.CellRange](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/bc5125).

<p>This example shows how to load an Excel file from your computer to the server using <strong>MVCxUploadControl</strong> and then display its data in <strong>MVCxGridView</strong>. <br>Steps to implement this task are the following:<br>1. Implement the Helper class that returns the DataTable object based on your Excel file.<br>2. Implement the HomeControllerUploadControlSettings class that contains the <em>FileUploadComplete</em> static method to save the uploaded file itself and its path to the <em>resultFilePath </em>variable. Also, in this class, implement the <em>UploadValidationSettings</em> property that returns UploadControl validation settings. <br>3. Map UploadControl's CallbackRouteValues property to the UploadControlUpload action. In this action, call the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebMvcUploadControlExtension_GetUploadedFilestopic(amq38w)">UploadControlExtension.GetUploadedFiles(UploadControlSettings,EventHandler<FileUploadCompleteEventArgs>)</a> method to pass UploadControl validation settings and invoke your FileUploadComplete method. <br>4. In the GridViewPartial action, get the DataTable object using the helper class and pass this table as a model to your _GridViewPartial.<br><strong><br>Note:</strong></p>
<p>The DevExpress.Docs assembly is used in this example. So, the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Document-Server/">Document Server</a> subscription license is required to implement the demonstrated approach.<br><br><strong>See also:</strong><br><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E5199">How to load an excel file to the server using ASPxUploadControl and display its data in ASPxGridView</a></p>
